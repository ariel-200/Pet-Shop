# PetShop

PetShop is a web application built using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and C#. The project simulates a pet adoption store where users can browse animals, add pets to a shopping cart, and complete a make-believe checkout process.

The application includes an admin section where animals can be created, edited, deleted, and marked as available or unavailable. Animal and category data is stored using a SQLite database, and session state is used to manage the shopping cart.
